### D&D Miscellany & Others

These are a collection of homebrews for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition that I have personally made over time. You may peruse the `RELEASES` folder if you choose to find PDF downloads of these homebrews, or the `SOURCES` folder if you seek to contribute or make amends to them. Using a compatible browser, you can directly view the PDFs, too.

The homebrews in this repository have been minimally playtested, though some have only graduated the showerthoughts phase. Before using any of them, it is highly recommended that you receive a DM's permission, as you may otherwise skew a perfectly good game with the homebrews' highly untested design decisions.

All homebrews are produced using the brilliant [The Homebrewery tool by NaturalCrit](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com), if you find any of the contents here helpful, you should extend the gratitude towards the authors of The Homebrewery (such as by helping them out in their [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/NaturalCrit)! Without The Homebrewery, no PDFs here would be made as tidily with so little effort on my part.

As with any and all homebrews, they are not related to Dungeons & Dragons, or Wizards of the Coast. These are *unofficial*, *fan-made* contents. Any similarities with other homebrews are purely coincidental, unless otherwise stated.
