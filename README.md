### D&D Miscellany & Others

These are a collection of homebrews for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition that I have made over time. You may peruse the `RELEASE` folder if you choose to find PDF downloads of these homebrews, or the `SOURCE` folder if you seek to contribute or make amends to the homebrews.

The homebrews in this repository have been minimally playtested, though some have only graduated the showerthoughts phase. Before using any of them, it is highly recommended that you receive a DM's permission, as you may otherwise skew a perfectly good game with the homebrews' bad design decisions.

All homebrews are produced using the brilliant [The Homebrewery tool by NaturalCrit](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com), if you find any of the contents here helpful, you should extend the gratitude towards them (such as by helping them out in their [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/NaturalCrit)! Without The Homebrewery, no PDFs would be made as tidily as they are at the moment.

As with any and all homebrews, they are not related to Dungeons & Dragons, or Wizards of the Coast. These are *unofficial*, *fan-made* homebrews. Any similarities with other homebrews are purely coincidental, unless otherwise stated.
