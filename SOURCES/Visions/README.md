## Teyvat's Chosen: Visions
***Elemental reactions, all class-agnostic***
***

You have been chosen by a certain pantheon to wield great power: a control over the elements. Different from simple spells and miracles, this power governs the ability to even transmute those spells into the element closest to you.

> **This homebrew is a playtest material! None of it has been tested thoroughly, and I trust you have it in you to accept the fact that you will/may damage a campaign by adding this homebrew.**

#### Features

- Class-agnostic feats: whether you are a melee fighter or a spell-slinging sorcerer, this homebrew should support your style of combat. You can enhance your regular attacks by changing their damage type, surprising even a keen opponent, or twist spells to abide to your element.
- Reflavouring, with impact: change a spell damage type to any that fits your character's archetype, all without the fuss of deciding the effects. Want to make an ice mage? Don't feel limited by 5e abysmal selection of ice-themed spells: just make your own!
- Visions can work in aiding any opportune adventuring moment. Your Vision acts as a spellcasting focus and alongside that, you can use it to conjure simple manifestations of your elements.
- A mechanic for elemental reactions, allowing you to exploit a creature's structure and the elements imbued within them. These reactions are plentiful, helping you in taking down mighty foes, or giving you brief respite with meaningful resistances.
- Augment your Vision with secondary feats. These feats give your Vision even more power, such as granting permanent resistance, or adding a second effect to your elementally-charged attacks.
