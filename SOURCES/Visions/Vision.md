# Teyvat's Chosen

Throughout the land of Teyvat, it is common for warriors and adventurers alike to wield a power granted unto them by their gods. Whether through devout prayers, pure chance, or an overbearing achievement, these select few are given one-of-a-kind artifact that seals their position in the eyes of the gods.

---

## Vision Adept
##### Feat
You have been chosen by the Archons of Teyvat, and you have with you a Vision that represents your status. Choose one of the elements within the Vision Elements table to determine the element of your Vision.

----

##### Vision Elements
| Element | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Geo  | The element that commands the earth and its land. Geo is an inert and sturdy element.|
| Anemo  | The free-flowing Anemo represents the wind. An opposite of Geo, it is the lightest and most reactive element of all.|
| Electro | The wielders of Electro speak the tongue of lightning and thunder. Sharp, fast, and agile. |
| Hydro | Hydro is a serene and reserved element. It moves in great force when disturbed, imparting judgement akin to the domain of its Archon. |
| Pyro | Pyro creates the purest fire; a power to wage wars and the element of warriors.|
| Cryo | Frigid and impossibly cold. Cryo symbolizes the elemental ice, the tundra and frozen stream. |
| Dendro | The forests and grasslands of Teyvat are brimmed with Dendro. Leaves, twigs, and branches are within the control of Dendro, no matter their size. |

##### Vision 
A Vision is different from a regular magic item; a Vision acts like a cursed item: it can't be unequipped or removed from you, it can't be destroyed through means short of a Wish spell, and it is always attuned to you but it doesn't count towards your attuned items.
  
  You can receive a Vision even if you have no faith towards the gods that granted it. As such, a paladin or cleric of strong belief towards a certain god may yet still receive a Vision from the Archons of Teyvat.
  
  A Vision becomes a mundane item when its owner passes away. It can reactivate under a new hand, however such occurence is close to improbability, requiring the Vision to resonate properly with its new owner.
  
  You can't lend or give a Vision, or dispose it by mundane means. Others may be able to touch or move it, despite that, it always return to you through means that seem supernatural or otherworldly.
</div>


Your Vision is tailored towards you. Choose one of the styles below to determine how you use your Vision.

When you gain your Vision, you gain elemental charges equal to 2 + your proficiency bonus, and you gain additional points every time your proficiency bonus increases. You regain all expended charges when you finish a long rest.

Unless otherwise stated, the DC to resist the effects of your Vision is equal to your spell save DC. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for the purpose of determining your DC if you don't have a spellcasting ability.

#### Infusion
Your Vision can apply its power to every swing of sword, every arrows shot, and every spears hurled. Your attacks become imbued by the element of your Vision, turning it magical.

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can spend one elemental charge to substitute the damage type you deal with that attack with one of the damage types listed in the Element Substitution table. The attack is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming damage resistances and immunities.

#### Catalyst
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell*

----

Your Vision is a spellcasting focus. You are not required to hold it when casting a spell. When you cast a spell that deals a certain damage type, you can spend one elemental charge to apply the element of your Vision, substituting the damage type of the spell with the one closest to your Vision, as determined by the Element Substitution table.

If the spell you cast using your Vision produces a perceptible output, such as the water made using create or destroy water, or the radiant light made by sunbeam, the output is altered according to the element of your Vision. For instance, create or destroy water will create a piece of boulder, and sunbeam will fail to generate any radiant light.

----

##### Element Substitution
| Element | Damage Type |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Geo  | Force, bludgeoning |
| Anemo  | Force, bludgeoning, slashing |
| Electro | Lightning, thunder |
| Hydro | Cold, acid, bludgeoning |
| Pyro | Fire, radiant |
| Cryo | Cold, force, piercing |
| Dendro | Necrotic, poison, piercing |

## Resonance
A Vision-wielder can resonate with their element to funnel a greater power as they grow closer to their Vision. This elemental resonance can occur even without the wielder knowing.

When gaining any Resonance feats below, you may have experienced a profound, life-changing event that led you towards putting faith in your Vision.

Choose one of the damage types of your element as listed in the Elements Substitution table. The target takes damage of the chosen type equal to 1d8 + your Spellcasting ability modifier and it is marked with your elemental sigil.

## Reactions

When an element of a Vision reacts with the natural matters of the material plane, it can produce an elemental reaction, owing to their magical yet divine nature.

Discuss with your DM when you intend to use this mechanic. You may use portions of it, or none at all. Your campaign can conform the use of Visions without requiring the existence of Reactions.

### Elemental Sigil

When you hit a creature with a spell or a weapon attack imbued by your element, you mark a creature with a sigil. This sigil is magical and can only be dispelled by casting remove curse.

A creature that is marked by a sigil readily reacts to the elements of its surrounding. When a sigil creates a reaction, it vanishes in the same turn.

Unless otherwise stated, an elemental sigil can only react to one other element. If this element is present before a creature is marked a sigil, then a reaction occurs and the sigil vanishes. An elemental reaction may readily be available with one of the following situations:

- **Electro**: The creature was struck by a spell or an attack that deals lightning damage before its next turn.
- **Hydro**: The creature is drenched in a gallon of water, standing on the surface of water, or submerged in water.
- **Pyro**: The creature or its equipment is on fire, or it's standing near an ignited fire source.
- **Cryo**: The creature was struck by a spell or an attack that deals cold damage before its next turn, or surrounded by extreme cold.

If a creature is made of a reactive element (such is the case with elementals), or imbued with a reactive element, it reacts immediately to an elemental sigil.

### Common Reactions

A reaction is a mingling of two elements together. The basis of a creation is the elemental sigil, but to create a reaction, you only need one elemental sigil. A sigil may induce one of the following reactions:

- **Charged** (Electro & Hydro): The target has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn. It retains this disadvantage if it starts its turn near a body of water.
- **Explosion** (Electro & Pyro): Each creature within a 5-foot-radius, centered on the target of the reaction, must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away, taking 1d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Conduction** (Electro & Cryo): The target takes a -1 AC penalty until the end of its next turn.
- **Cold** (Hydro & Cryo): The target has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.
- **Vaporize** (Hydro & Pyro): The target takes damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus as a fire or acid damage (your choice).
- **Melt** (Pyro & Cryo): The target takes damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus as a fire or cold damage (your choice).

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

### Special Reactions

#### Geo

When a creature is marked with a Geo sigil, you gain a resistance to one damage type determined by the creature's resistances or immunities, as long as it is one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, radiant, thunder. If a creature has no resistances or immunities to any of the damage types, you gain no resistance. This reaction has a duration of 2 turns.

This reaction replenishes the temporary hit points you receive from the Crystal Shield feat. The amount of temporary hit points you regain is equal to your proficiency bonus.

If a creature is made of solid earth and rock, any elemental sigil it receives creates this reaction at the start of its turn.

#### Anemo

For situations that apply, each creature within a 5-foot-square area, centered on the target of the sigil, receives elemental sigils as the wind draws in elemental energy from the surrounding environment. If multiple sigils are drawn, they react in the same turn.

Any leftover sigil that isn't consumed by a reaction vanishes.

When you mark a creature with an Anemo sigil twice, the creature takes force damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus. The sigils vanish as if a reaction had occured.

#### Dendro

A creature marked by the Dendro sigil can be lit as if it was submerged in oil. The target takes damage equal to your proficiency bonus at the start of each of its turn for a duration of 4 turns. The target takes fire damage if it's lit, otherwise it takes poison damage for the duration.

The fire started by this reaction can't spread or ignite other objects or creatures within the vicinity of the target, unless they are marked with a Dendro sigil.

### Environmental Reactions

You may create a weak reaction to interact with the environment, such as by starting a fire with your weapon. A weak reaction can deal 1 damage, with a damage type determined by your Element Substitution. When you use your Vision this way, you expend one elemental charge.

Weak reactions can be used to alter the envirionment to your advantage. As a non-exhaustive list, you can do one of the following with your weak reaction:

- **Geo**: Produce a small bump on the ground, or create a piece of small rock.
- **Anemo**: Push a light object with wind, or blow a gentle breeze.
- **Electro**: Generate a quick spark of electricity.
- **Hydro**: Create a gallon of water.
- **Pyro**: Start and maintain a small fire. Fire made with a weak reaction has the same property as a fire started using a tinderbox.
- **Cryo**: Freeze a body of water. The water must not exceed half of a gallon in volume.
- **Dendro**: Enrich one plant, causing it to yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
