## Otterfolk
***A race with a disdain for deceit***

Otterfolk inhabit the Feywild, yet unlike other denizen of the plane, they never seek to create a circle of distrust. But why would such a race consider roaming to lands hitherto unknown?

This homebrew contains a playable race, as well as three feats meant to be paired with Otterfolk itself. Although the race should be fairly safe to insert into any campaign, the feats are wholly untested and may break your game. If you are a DM that is considering on allowing your players to use this race, please keep that in mind!

#### Race Features
- A sharp mind and a sharp wit; Otterfolk remember many past events with uncanny clarity - even more so if they have been lied to.
- Swim fast! Otterfolk may strut awkwardly in the land, but their 45 feet swim speed is worthy of envy. Not only that, Otterfolk also gain significant advantage when stealthing in the waters.
- Otterfolk are masters of judging character: Insight proficiency, amplified with advantage towards resisting the charmed condition.
- Start with two additional languages: Aquan (Primordial) and Sylvan.
- Of course, *darkvision*!
