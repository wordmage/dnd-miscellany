# Otterfolk

In the treachery and mischievous wonders of the Feywild, one can find the veritable and noble Otterfolk. The Otterfolk represent the quality unfound in most of Feywild: dutiful respect and equality of contract.

### Truth over Matter

Otterfolk value the quality of honesty and contract. This trait grants them the natural talent at mercantile and record-keeping, as no race fares equally in their hardy nature at making sure no lies become truths. When one comes into aid for an Otterfolk, they can rest easy knowing that their service will not go unnoticed, as even the slightest assistance will be repaid in kind.

An Otterfolk will remember lies until their death, then they will pass the story of these lies unto their children. Many tales and legends that originate from Otterfolk are born this way, rooting from a betrayal their distant kin experienced many thousands years ago.

### Land-Roamer

Many Otterfolk leave the Feywild to roam the common lands. Otterfolk travel in a clan (commonly referred as a holt) of 4 to 10 members and they seek dams, rivers, and flowing waters to inhabit, and will oftentimes mingle with existing civilization, even forming a contract with the people there. Otterfolk will trade goods, service, and knowledge for something of an equal value: an abode, food, gold, or even magical devices.

### Otterfolk Names

An Otterfolk’s name is granted to them after they reach maturity. To an Otterfolk, a name is a distinction and a unique trait that indicates their worth. An Otterfolk may find themselves changing their name should they be unable to provide the service that their name gives.
